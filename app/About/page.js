        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 text-center max-w-3xl mb-4">
          Founded in 2023, Mawenzi Health is dedicated to transforming healthcare delivery by providing comprehensive nurse triage, patient scheduling, and care coordination services for healthcare providers. We work closely with private clinics, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health clinics, and health systems to improve patient access, streamline operations, and enhance health outcomes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 text-center max-w-3xl mb-4">
          Our mission is to support health centers in reducing utilization, improving patient outcomes, and optimizing quality metricsâ€”leading to a lower total cost of care through expert care management solutions. We bridge the gap between providers and patients, ensuring timely access to care, reduced emergency room utilization, and better chronic disease management.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 text-center max-w-3xl">
          At the core of our approach is a commitment to health equity, integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into patient care. We partner with clinics, hospitals, and healthcare organizations that share our vision for sustainable, high-quality patient care.
